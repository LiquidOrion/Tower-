  Project to develop software along with the following requirements:
  
  
Group participation and teamwork
All team members are required to be active participants in the project. All team members should be equally involved in aspects such as planning, documentation, development, and testing. Individuals bring unique abilities, so some specialization is permissible and expected. If you feel that a member of your team is not participating adequately, your first response should be to work as a group with that person to figure out why and how tasks or group process can be reworked to ensure that everyone can participate to the best of their ability. If the problem cannot be resolved within the group, you may bring it to me.

 Each group must decide on [a] method[s] of communication to use outside of the project meeting time. These methods must be accessible to all group members (i.e., Apple's "face time" could be a poor choice because it requires proprietary hardware).

 Attendance at the project meeting is required and attendance will be taken. If you miss a project meeting, your first responsibility is to your group to work with them to catch up on what you missed and continue to contribute toward the current goals. If you miss more than one project meeting, please let me know why.

 Each team member will be required individually (not seen by the rest of the team) to evaluate their own contributions to the project and the contributions of other team members. 


Project scope
Aim for something that you think you could put together in about two weeks working on your own with no distractions.

 Process is more important than product in this course. Expect to need to revise your project scope. It would be nice if you have something functional to demonstrate at the end, but if not, you can demonstrate your documentation and discuss your process and issues you encountered.

 Any and all intellectual property used in the project must be created by the team, be public domain, or be made available under a suitable license. 


Source code management
Source code management is an important part of software development (even for individuals, Dave reminds himself). Team are required to use their choice of system (i.e., git, mercurial, etc) and be able to document its use (i.e., logs). 


UML Diagrams
The Unified Modeling Language is not universally used, but it's good to be familiar with it. Your project documentation must include examples of at least three different types of UML diagrams. At least one must be customer-oriented (i.e., presented in the software requirements specification); at least one must be developer-oriented (included in internal documentation). 


Milestone deliverables
Some of these can/should partially or entirely be delivered as part of the IEEE-style Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
• Initial project proposal (standalone initially is okay; incorporate into SRS before final version)
• Functional requirements (SRS entirely)
• System requirements (SRS entirely)
• System test plan
• Documentation



• Project presentation
